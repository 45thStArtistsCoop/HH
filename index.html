									<p>The <span class="display">Horton + Holden</span> membership will receive a reduction in operating expenses of $7,000 a month beginning in August of 2019 when the last payment in our mortgage is made.</p>
									<p>The new difference between our assessments and our expenses will begin accruing in our reserve account on that date, where it will remain until used as the membership chooses.
									The implementation of those choices will be determined later by the whole community, but first we must all learn what we all want.</p>

									<p><span class="display">H+H</span> members present at the initial meeting, understanding that <strong>education</strong> will be required to make informed choices on the options to be considered, formulated a process that will include the entire membership in the periodic dissemination of information and questions about preferences. </p>
									<p>Here is the rough outline of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/process">the process</a> to achieve that:</p>
